# Seat Post Attachment Tool - Task Summary

## What's Already Set Up

1. **Basic Infrastructure**
   - Dashboard tab named "Pedro" accessible without login
   - Basic page layout with upload functionality
   - 3D viewer using React Three Fiber
   - File validation for GLB/GLTF formats

2. **Dependencies**
   - React Three Fiber and Drei libraries installed
   - Three.js core library available

3. **Documentation**
   - README with task overview
   - ATTACHMENT_POINTS.md with technical guidance
   - SAMPLE_MODELS.md with resources for test models

## What You Need to Implement

### 1. Attachment Point System
- Create UI for adding and editing attachment planes
- Implement visual representation of attachment planes in the 3D viewer
- Add ability to manipulate planes (position, rotation, scale)

### 2. Alignment Logic
- Develop algorithms to align the seat post with a predefined frame plane
- Implement automatic positioning and rotation
- Add validation to ensure proper alignment

### 3. Measurement Input
- Create form inputs for seat post dimensions
- Implement scaling based on user measurements
- Add validation for measurements

### 4. Metadata Storage
- Design a data structure for storing attachment points
- Implement saving/loading of attachment data
- Ensure compatibility with the existing system

### 5. User Experience
- Create clear, intuitive UI for the entire workflow
- Add helpful tooltips and guidance
- Implement error handling and validation feedback

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Keep components modular and reusable
   - Follow the existing project structure
   - Use TypeScript for type safety

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize 3D rendering for smooth interaction
   - Consider lazy loading for heavy components
   - Be mindful of memory usage with large 3D models

3. **Documentation**
   - Document your code thoroughly
   - Update README as needed
   - Create additional documentation for complex features
